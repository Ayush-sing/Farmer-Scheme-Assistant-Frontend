# 🌾 Farmer Scheme Assistant (AI Govt. Scheme Chatbot)

A modern AI-powered web app that helps Indian farmers discover relevant **government schemes** (central + state-ready design) using natural language queries — with **official source links**, **voice typing**, and **read aloud** support.

## ✅ Key Features

### 🤖 AI Scheme Search (ChatGPT-like)
- Farmers can type normal messages like:
  - “I want to buy a tractor, is there any subsidy or loan scheme?”
  - “My crop got damaged due to rainfall, which insurance scheme can help?”
- The system understands the user’s intent and returns **relevant schemes** with explanation.

### 📌 Official Sources
- Every scheme is returned with an **official link**
- Output also provides short summary, eligibility, and benefits

### 🔎 Smart Matching (Future-Proof)
- Uses a **unified scheme knowledge base** (`schemes_clean.jsonl`)
- Uses **FAISS + embeddings** for fast semantic search
- Uses **multi-intent reranking** so results are not random or generic

### 🎙️ Voice + Accessibility
- ✅ Voice typing (English + Hindi)
- ✅ Read aloud (Text-to-Speech)

### 📱 Responsive UI
- Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
